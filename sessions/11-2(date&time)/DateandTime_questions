 1) Difference between strptime and strftime:
 
    -Both are used for date time operations. strptime is for parsing date time input, strftime is for formatting date time output. 
    -Strptime : str points to time
    -Strftime : string from time
    -strptime could be replaced by DateTime.parse where strf is all about formatting the r      esultant date and time.
    -The strptime function converts characters to time objects. 
   -The strftime function converts time objects to characters. 

2)Difference between Loops and Iterators:

The difference is quite subtle indeed. Both loops and iterators are used to repeat a chunk of code. Loops are an ancient idea, they existed long before computers did. Almost every programming language has some kind of loops. Iterators are relatively new, and they only exist in a few languages such as Ruby.

Loops are both powerful and dangerous: itâ€™s too easy to break your program by producing a so called infinite loop, if you fail to ensure that the termination condition (the one that must be true so the loop stops) really occurs.

3)Difference between Each and Collect:

.collect is a synonym for .map. Like .each, the collect method will yield each member of an Array to the block. But unlike .each (which just returns the original Array), .collect will collect the results in a new array and return that instead.
